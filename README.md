# Task Management App Readme

## Description

The Task Management App is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It is built using React for the frontend, Redux for state management, and utilizes local storage for storing and retrieving tasks. This project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for developers, offering hands-on experience in building a multi-page web application with user authentication.

## Project Requirements

To ensure the successful development of the Task Management App, the following technologies and practices are employed:

- **React Router**: I use React Router to manage multiple pages within the application. Each page is defined as a separate route, providing a structured and organized user experience.

- **Redux/Redux Toolkit**: Redux is implemented for state management. It plays a crucial role in managing the list of tasks and user authentication, offering a centralized and predictable state container.

- **Styled-components**: To maintain a consistent and visually appealing user interface across all pages, we employ styled-components for styling the components in the project.

## Project Features

The Task Management App boasts a range of features designed to enhance task management and user experience:

### Authentication Pages

1. **Sign Up Page**: Users can register with a unique username and password, enabling them to create an account.

2. **Log In Page**: Registered users can securely log in to their accounts.

3. **Logout Button**: Users can log out from any page, ensuring data privacy and security.

### Dashboard Page

After successful login, users are redirected to the Dashboard, where they can:

- **View a List of Tasks**: The Dashboard displays a list of tasks, making it easy for users to track their activities.

- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks based on their status (e.g., completed, incomplete), helping them prioritize their work.

- **Task Details**: By clicking on a task, users can view its details, facilitating a deeper understanding of the task at hand.

- **Create New Tasks**: Users have the ability to create new tasks, making it simple to add new items to their to-do lists.

- **Update Existing Tasks**: Existing tasks can be edited and updated, allowing users to modify task details as needed.

### Task Details Page

When users click on a task from the Dashboard, they are taken to a dedicated Task Details page, where they can:

- **View Task Details**: Users can access comprehensive details about the selected task, including its description, due date, and status.

- **Edit and Update Task Details**: Task details can be edited and updated, ensuring that users can keep their tasks up-to-date.

- **Delete the Task**: Users have the option to delete a task when it is no longer relevant or necessary.

### User Profile Page

The User Profile Page offers users a place to:

- **View and Edit Profile Information**: Users can view and modify their profile information, including their username and other personal details.

- **Change Password**: Users can change their passwords to maintain the security of their accounts.
